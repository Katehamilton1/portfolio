## bio
*  Hello, I'm Kate. I am attending UC Berkeley's full-stack boot camp with the vision to design and create new applications. I currently live in Saudi Arabia, but was raised in North Carolina for most my life. I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, trying new food, learning new skills , and reading a book with a cup of coffee at hand. I have been a speech-language pathologist since 2018.  I became interested in pursuing coding due to the lack of software and applications on the market for speech pathologists to use to support their patients.  The more I code, the more I find a new passion I never knew I had.
